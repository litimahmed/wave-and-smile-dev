# Full-Stack Engineering Mastery
*A comprehensive learn-by-building course that teaches modern web application development through milestone-driven progression*

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Structure

This course follows a **milestone-based progression** where you build a complete application through professional development phases.

### ðŸ“ˆ Milestones
Each milestone delivers a working product increment:
- **[M1 â€” Platform Signature Ready](./docs/milestones/milestone-01/index.md)** - Design system and foundation
- **[M2 â€” User Interface Complete](./docs/milestones/milestone-02/index.md)** - Full interactive frontend
- **[M3 â€” Data Layer Integration](./docs/milestones/milestone-03/index.md)** - Backend and database connection

### ðŸ”„ Development Phase Structure

Every milestone follows a **standardized 5-phase development cycle** that mirrors professional software development workflows:

#### **1. Plan Phase** - Strategic & Architectural Decisions
- **Purpose**: Make high-level strategic decisions and define system architecture
- **Focus**: Requirements analysis, component architecture planning, integration strategy
- **Outcome**: Clear roadmap and architectural blueprint for implementation
- **Note**: No coding happens here - pure strategic planning and decision-making

#### **2. Setup Phase** - Technical Configuration & Environment
- **Purpose**: Configure development environment, tooling, and technical infrastructure
- **Focus**: Tool installation, workspace organization, type definitions, workflow configuration
- **Outcome**: Fully configured development environment ready for implementation
- **Note**: Environment preparation only - no feature development or concept teaching

#### **3. Build Phase** - Hands-On Learning & Implementation
- **Purpose**: Learn concepts through practical implementation of features
- **Focus**: **Primary learning phase** - concepts taught while building real functionality
- **Outcome**: Working features with deep understanding of underlying concepts
- **Note**: This is where actual learning and skill development occurs

#### **4. Test Phase** - Validation & Quality Assurance
- **Purpose**: Validate functionality, test user flows, and ensure quality standards
- **Focus**: Feature testing, behavior validation, performance verification
- **Outcome**: Verified, high-quality implementation ready for deployment
- **Note**: Quality assurance and validation only

#### **5. Release Phase** - Deployment & Documentation
- **Purpose**: Deploy features and document learnings for future reference
- **Focus**: Production deployment, documentation creation, milestone wrap-up
- **Outcome**: Live deployed features with comprehensive documentation
- **Note**: Deployment and knowledge consolidation
