# Course Supplements

Professional-grade supplementary content to deepen understanding of core concepts.

## How Supplements Work

Supplements are optional deep-dive content that enhance the main milestone progression:

- **Integration**: Each supplement is introduced at the perfect moment within a milestone
- **Context**: Custom intros explain exactly why and when to watch
- **Application**: Immediate connection back to your project work
- **Professional Value**: Industry-standard practices and advanced techniques

## Supplement Categories

### Technical Deep Dives
Advanced exploration of technologies introduced in milestones.

### Industry Practices
Professional workflows, conventions, and best practices.

### Architecture Patterns
System design concepts and architectural decision-making.

### Performance & Optimization
Advanced techniques for production-ready applications.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Milestone-Driven**: Only access supplements when prompted during milestones
2. **Project-Connected**: Always relate supplement content back to your project
3. **Just-in-Time**: Learn when you need it, apply immediately
4. **Optional but Valuable**: Supplements enhance but don't replace core progression

## Coming Soon
Supplement content will be added as milestones are developed and integrated points are identified.
