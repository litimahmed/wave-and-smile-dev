# Course Philosophy & Methodology

## Core Philosophy

> "This course's intention was never to dive deep into technologies, but to show a comprehensive roadmap and how technologies integrate with each other - because at the end of the day, that's what only matters in real-life projects."

## Learning Approach

### Integration Over Isolation
- Learn technologies in context of solving real problems
- Understand how different tools work together in a complete system
- Focus on the "why" and "when" rather than exhaustive "what"

### Just-in-Time Learning
- Learn concepts when the project needs them
- Immediate application reinforces understanding
- No theoretical knowledge that sits unused

### Roadmap Thinking
- See the bigger picture of how everything connects
- Understand decision-making processes in real development
- Build systems thinking alongside technical skills

## Why This Matters
In real projects, you don't need to know every TypeScript feature or every React pattern. You need to know:
- Which tool solves which problem
- How to make technologies work together
- How to learn what you need, when you need it
- How to build systems that scale and maintain

This course teaches you to think like a full-stack engineer, not just collect isolated technical knowledge.
