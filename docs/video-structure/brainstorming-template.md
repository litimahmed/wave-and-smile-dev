# Video Structure Template

## Sprint Planning Videos
Use this template to brainstorm and structure each sprint video:

### Pre-Video Brainstorming
- **Current Problem**: What specific challenge does this sprint solve?
- **Technology Integration**: Which technologies work together here?
- **Real-World Context**: How does this apply to actual projects?
- **Student Mindset**: What will students be thinking/feeling at this point?

### Video Structure
1. **Problem Introduction** (1-2 min)
   - What we're solving and why it matters
   
2. **Solution Approach** (2-3 min)
   - How technologies integrate to solve this
   - Why this combination of tools
   
3. **Building Process** (5-8 min)
   - Just-in-time learning moments
   - Integration points between technologies
   
4. **Reflection & Next Steps** (1-2 min)
   - What we learned about system integration
   - How this prepares us for the next challenge

### Post-Video Notes
- **Integration Lessons**: What did students learn about how technologies work together?
- **Next Sprint Setup**: What problem will naturally arise next?
- **Brainstorming Notes**: Ideas for improving or expanding this approach

## Video Series Progression
Each video should naturally lead to the next challenge, maintaining the "learn by building" flow.
